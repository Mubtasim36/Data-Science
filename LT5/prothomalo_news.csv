Among the three, Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman are absconding. Both are currently staying in India.
The only arrested accused in the case, Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, has confessed and given testimony in the tribunal as an “approver” or state witness. In his statement, he said that then–Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had directly ordered the use of “lethal weapons” to suppress the anti-discrimination student movement. He received this order on 18 July last year through then–Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan.

According to the investigation report, on Sheikh Hasina’s orders, lethal weapons were used to kill 1,500 innocent, unarmed students and civilians and injure 30,000 people in July–August 2024.

During closing arguments, the prosecution sought the maximum punishment—death penalty—for Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman. They also requested that their properties be confiscated and transferred to the families of those killed in July and to the injured July fighters.

The prosecution also stated that former IGP Mamun has disclosed the full truth of the events as an approver, and the tribunal will issue the appropriate order in his regard. On the other hand, state-appointed defence lawyers have sought acquittal for Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman.

Five charges 
Five charges 
A total of five charges have been brought against ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina and two other accused in the case involving crimes against humanity committed during the July mass uprising.

The five charges are: delivering inciting speeches; ordering the use of lethal weapons to suppress and eliminate protesters; the shooting and killing of Abu Sayed, a student of Begum Rokeya University, Rangpur; the shooting and killing of six protesters in Dhaka’s Chankharpul area; burning six people to death in Ashulia.

At a briefing at the tribunal premises yesterday, Sunday, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar Hossain Tamim said they had been able to prove all five charges beyond reasonable doubt. In the interest of justice, the prosecution will accept whatever order the tribunal delivers.

He added that the portion of the judgment that the tribunal reads out will be broadcast live, subject to the tribunal’s permission.

Bangladesh Police’s National Central Bureau (NCB) had applied to the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) for issuing a Red Notice against Sheikh Hasina.

Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said that if the tribunal convicts Sheikh Hasina, the prosecution will submit another request to Interpol for a “conviction warrant” to facilitate issuing a Red Notice.

Sheikh Hasina cannot appeal while absconding
Sheikh Hasina cannot appeal while absconding
At the briefing, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said that if Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman are sentenced, they cannot appeal because they are absconding. The tribunal law clearly states that an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the verdict. But to seek an appeal, a convicted accused must surrender. If law enforcement arrests them, they would then have the right to appeal.

A journalist asked whether the chief accused, being a woman, would receive any special legal privileges.

In response, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said that under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), women, the sick, juveniles, boys, and children are given priority in matters of bail. But in handing down sentences, no separate privilege exists for women under general law or tribunal law. Therefore, whether the accused is a woman or a man, the punishment will depend on the gravity of the crime. If the charges are not proven, the accused will be acquitted.

Another journalist asked about Sheikh Hasina’s recent interviews, in which she said she did not order killings directly.

In reply, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said Sheikh Hasina can present everything by appearing before the tribunal. Statements made without appearing carry no legal basis. Her voice recordings were played in open court and broadcast, and in those recordings she is heard giving the order for use of lethal weapons. No one in the world accused of crimes against humanity has ever admitted guilt.

On whether Sheikh Hasina is able to give interviews to various media outlets while staying in India, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said the prosecution views this purely as a governmental and diplomatic matter. The prosecution is not taking her statements into account. The government will take action regarding her statements.

On 2 July, the International Crimes Tribunal-1 sentenced Sheikh Hasina to six months’ simple imprisonment in a contempt of court case. The trial began in April this year.

Earlier in the year, an audio recording had circulated online in which Sheikh Hasina was heard saying, “I have now received a licence to kill 226 people.” The prosecution argued that the comment attempted to obstruct the judicial process, leading them to file a contempt case. The tribunal subsequently sentenced her.

On the media’s role regarding violence, Adviser Rizwana said that the media also has an opportunity to act more responsibly in cases of violence and cocktail attacks. The media can either spread panic or, by condemning those involved in the violence, help build public opinion against it.

"Maulana Bhasani’s ‘Silence’","https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/op-ed/e7q3vhnepj","Published: 17 Nov 2025, 02: 27","The person we know as 'Maulana Bhasani' was not originally named that. Neither of these two words was part of his real name. Both 'Maulana' and 'Bhasani' were titles or epithets he acquired later. 'Maulana' reflected his religious faith and practice, while 'Bhasani' became a symbol of his struggle and rebellion. His life and activities were such that his real name faded behind these titles. In fact, his birth name was Abdul Hamid Khan, and his childhood nickname was Chaga, which was how he was known in his early years.

He had none of the wealth, status, or family influence that typically help in political and social establishment. Yet he drew from every experience in life—from traveling theatre troupes to the Deoband Madrasa. Among these experiences, the trait that ultimately made him remarkable was his deep connection with the masses. This connection allowed him to see life through the lens of the collective, linking his life with the lives of those around him.

He viewed imperialism, feudalism, and capitalism not from a distance, but through the experiences of oppressed people. He understood that poverty, helplessness, and a life of deprivation were not mere fate—they were created and sustained by specific causes, systems, and power structures.

This understanding set him apart from other maulanas and pirs. In a hypocritical world, he became solitary, while among the people he became a leader of the oppressed. He was not just a voice for Muslims; he became the voice for all oppressed people of the so-called Third World, regardless of religion, ethnicity, or gender.

In our society, religious leaders such as maulanas and pirs hold immense power. Rulers and exploiters always support them to maintain their own authority. At the same time, countless people approach these religious figures to cope with unbearable lives. People seek relief from ailments, protection for their children, divine help in crises, and safety from cruel oppressors through prayers, talismans, or charms. Where there is no money for treatment, no doctors, no medicine, and where people’s own strength is unclear; where rivers erode, and tyrants and the powerful commit oppression—the oppressed see no other way but to turn to such religious paths.

Most religious leaders take money, offer advice, and urge people to be patient, to endure, to accept their fate with satisfaction. Yet these leaders themselves remain bound to the very oppressors who are few in number but hold power. The dependence of religious leaders on oppressors, and of oppressors on religious certification, creates a vicious cycle in which they protect each other. For the oppressed, this produces a deadlock. Amid storms and aggressions, the only guidance offered to the battered people is religious practice and patience in this life for infinite rewards in the next. Such leaders’ teachings are thus often infused with power, misogyny, communalism, and other social toxins.

Maulana Bhasani: A leader of the oppressed 
Maulana Bhasani: A leader of the oppressed 
Maulana Bhasani was also a pir (spiritual guide). Millions of people were his disciples. Because he did not discriminate based on religion, caste, or gender, anyone could approach him. Men and women of different faiths, and especially poor people oppressed and exploited by landlords, moneylenders, and the ruling classes, came to him for help. Unlike many religious figures, Bhasani did not derive his income from their suffering. He offered prayers, charms, and spiritual guidance, but if someone was seriously ill, he advised them to see a doctor and even provided money for medicine if needed.

Unlike many religious figures, Bhasani did not derive his income from their suffering. He offered prayers, charms, and spiritual guidance, but if someone was seriously ill, he advised them to see a doctor and even provided money for medicine if needed.
What set Maulana Bhasani apart, and in some ways made him the opposite of other religious leaders, was his approach to injustice. People came to him for guidance and shared the indescribable hardships and injustices of their lives. Bhasani’s stance was that such suffering was not fate, not a divine decree, and above all, could be changed if people were united. This perspective drove him to adopt a rebellious position against injustice from his youth. For him, 'Rebellion against injustice is righteous' became another name for his life.

Bhasani’s life, speeches, and struggle angered the Pakistani state, dominated by the ownership of Islam, as well as military rulers, landlords, moneylenders, feudal lords, and their favoured religious leaders.
He was labeled a 'traitor to India', a 'lungi-clad Maulana', and even an 'apostate'. This hostility from rulers and oppressors was essentially a class-based resentment. In appearance, lifestyle, speech, and demeanor, Bhasani belonged to the lower class. Through struggle, he gave voice to the oppressed within Islam, standing against the elite interpretation of the faith. While religion was treated as a safe haven monopolised by rulers and oppressors, Bhasani challenged that sanctuary.

Injustice and suffering are not abstract, nor do they descend from some unknown planet. By observing these experiences with responsibility and sensitivity, one can uncover a vast truth: the causes of inhumane lives, the social structures, rules, and systems behind them. It becomes clear which classes and groups maintain and enforce these systems, using every means to perpetuate them—and religion is not exempt. The struggle for total liberation cannot be indefinite or aimless; it requires envisioning and working toward a society that can free people from this hellish condition.
Bhasani did not aim for the monarchy of Saudi Arabia; he envisioned a society liberated from exploitation, oppression, and inequality. He sought a social system that could bring people joy, dignity, and humanity. The struggle to establish such a society, he presented as a duty and responsibility to the people.

Therefore, to free people from injustice, oppression, and suffering, prayers alone are not enough; what is needed is the creation of collective struggle. This understanding enabled Maulana to become the symbol of resistance known as Bhasani. This Bhasani stood against the overwhelming power and aggression of all kinds of oppressors, channeling the voices of millions into his own, and confronting authority with the immense strength of the people. He gave tangible form to the limitless power rising from among the oppressed. His warnings against the oppressors not only revitalised weary, oppressed, and struggling people but also seemed to animate nature itself—'Silence!'

With this resolve, Maulana Bhasani participated in the 1971 Liberation War and, in the post-independence and disillusioned years, became a symbol of people’s despair and aspirations. He challenged the power of India’s ruling class and shook the country against the oppression at Farakka. Although his influence was undermined at times by the errors and impulsiveness of leftist leaders, and he himself faced moments of despair, his strengths and limitations both offer lessons for our struggle.

Fifty-four years after independence, at a time when the people of Bangladesh are facing setbacks contrary to the hopes of mass uprisings—confronted by imperialism, the multifaceted aggression of domestic and foreign rulers, plundering by various looter groups, confusion from the expansion of religious-fascist politics—Maulana Bhasani repeatedly emerges as a powerful voice for the liberation of the oppressed, challenging local and foreign tyrants, calling again and again: 'Silence!'

Faruk Ahmed Talukdar, president of the Shariatpur Bus Owners Association, told Prothom Alo that vehicles between Dhaka and Shariatpur have been operating since morning. No vehicle has faced obstruction along the route. However, passenger turnout is low and the number of vehicles on the road is also thin.

When asked, Shariatpur’s superintendent of police, Nazrul Islam, told Prothom Alo that vehicular movement across the Padma Bridge is normal, as on other days.

As a programme has been announced by a particular organisation, patrols have been increased to ensure the security of important infrastructure around the Padma bridge.

Superintendent of police, Nazrul Islam further stated, “Yesterday, Sunday, the home adviser made a brief stop while travelling to Dhaka. At that time, we exchanged courtesies. Until this morning, no unwanted incident has occurred in the areas surrounding the Padma bridge or on the expressway in Shariatpur. We are making every effort to ensure the safety of the public.”

"One in every two girls subjected to child marriage","https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/19igfi5dzc","Published: 17 Nov 2025, 03: 05","The rate of child marriage among girls under 18 has fallen from 60 per cent to 56 per cent, but the situation remains high, with one in every two girls in the country still subjected to child marriage. Compared to 2019, this rate has decreased by 4 per cent.

Institutional deliveries, meaning births at health facilities or hospitals, have increased. Alongside this, the rate of births by caesarean section (C-section) has also risen. Mortality among children from birth up to under five years of age has decreased. Child labour and the proportion of out-of-school children have risen.

The figures came up in the newly published Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) report by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and UNICEF. The survey report was released today, Sunday, at the China–Bangladesh Friendship Conference Centre in Agargaon, Dhaka.

The report states that the survey was conducted in two phases from January to June this year, covering nearly 63,000 households. It included 172 indicators and 27 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indices, aligned with national priorities and global standards.

For the first time, the survey included tests for anaemia among pregnant women and children, as well as levels of heavy metal contamination including cadmium. The previous MICS report was published in 2019, and the new report also presents a comparative picture showing how much progress or decline has occurred since then.

The event was chaired by BBS director general Mohammad Mizanur Rahman. As special guests, Aleya Akter, Secretary of the Statistics and Information Management Division, attended, and UNICEF Bangladesh representative Rana Flowers was present as a distinguished guest.

Rana Flowers said that the rates of child marriage and child mortality demonstrate that progress is possible. Crises such as heavy metal contamination and child labour are depriving millions of children of their potential. Investment in child protection must be increased.

The welcome speech at the event was delivered by Mohammad Masud Rana Chowdhury. Emdadul Haque, the focal point officer of MICS, presented the main findings of the report. The open discussion session was conducted by BBS deputy director Md Alamgir Hossain.

The survey report provides two sets of data on child marriage. Before turning 18, 47 per cent of women aged 20–24 were married, whereas this rate was 51 per cent in the 2019 report. Meanwhile, the nationwide rate of child marriage among girls under 18 has stood at 56 per cent, which was previously 60 per cent.

The rate of childbirth among adolescent mothers has risen from 83 to 92 per thousand. Compared with 2019, caesarean (C-section) deliveries have increased by 16 per cent to nearly 52 per cent. Institutional deliveries at healthcare facilities or hospitals have increased by 18 per cent to 71 per cent.

Institutional deliveries at healthcare facilities or hospitals have increased by 18 per cent to 71 per cent.
Child labour has risen by more than 2 per cent to 9 per cent. The share of school-age children not attending secondary school has increased by 2 per cent to nearly 34 per cent. Use of contraceptives has dropped by 5 per cent to 58 per cent. The total fertility rate (TFR) has increased from 2.3 to 2.4.

While moderating the panel discussion at the event, former adviser to the caretaker government Hossain Zillur Rahman said that this MICS report is an important step towards open data. The data should be easily accessible so that it can be discussed on a wider scale. Two sets of data have come regarding child marriage. The question remains as to which one should be used in policymaking. The underlying stories behind why the rate is rising in some areas and falling in others should come out. The quality of the survey needs to be improved.

The speakers emphasised reducing the disparity between urban and rural areas in the supply of safe water. They urged the government to strengthen monitoring to reduce the high rate of C-sections. Apart from this, four more panel discussions were held at the event.

The report said child mortality declined across all five age-specific groups under five. Among children under five, 33 out of every 1,000 live births die, down from the previous rate of 40 per 1,000.

The rate of stunted children fell to 24 per cent. However, the rate of wasted children rose by 3 per cent to about 13 per cent. The share of underweight children increased slightly to 23 per cent, while the rate of overweight children declined somewhat.

The rate of receiving four antenatal care visits stands at 43 per cent. The proportion of women who received at least one antenatal care visit has increased from 58 to nearly 76 per cent. However, the rate of receiving the full four quality visits remains low at just 43 per cent.

Among children under five, only 59 per cent have birth registration. As a result, many children are deprived of legal identity and access to services.

The new survey results show that 38 per cent of children aged 12–59 months and nearly 8 per cent of pregnant women have cadmium levels in their blood above safe limits. Dhaka (65 per cent) is the most affected area. Cadmium contamination poses a threat to children’s brain development, affecting all socioeconomic groups. More than half of the affected children belong to wealthy households, while 30 per cent belong to poor communities. Nearly half of drinking water sources and over 80 per cent of household water samples are contaminated with E. coli bacteria. The report highlights issues of safe water, sanitation, and the rising rate of school absenteeism among children.

Exactly one year after the Samata Party’s launching, the People’s Power Party was formed out of a desire to “do something for the country”.

However, the organisers could not produce a full list of advisers that day.

According to Prothom Alo’s tally, at least 26 political parties have emerged in the 15 months following the July mass uprising. Six of those parties have the word “janata” (people) in their names in some form. Launching of most of the political parties were announced through press conferences at the National Press Club; a few held their events at the Central Shaheed Minar, while one party was announced by organising a procession on the Dhaka University campus.

On 25 October, this correspondent met him on Topkhana Road. He said he could not rent an office for the party due to financial constraints. That is why he sits at a labour federation office, which has been provided in the application to the EC for registration.

Hanif Bangladeshi said, “I marched on foot from Teknaf to Tetulia in 2018 demanding voting rights, democracy and the rule of law. I even staged a march to the home of Felani with a symbolic dead body in protest against border killings.”

Asked why he floated a political party, he said existing parties fail to honour their promises made to the people. Besides, it was hard to move ahead without an organisation.

Uprising-themed graffiti inside party office 
Of the 26 new parties, only NCP has a large, well-equipped office on the 16th floor of Rupayan Tower at Banglamotor in the capital. The walls are decorated with graffiti referencing the mass uprising. The office includes modern facilities for press conferences and meetings, separate rooms for the convener and member secretary, and additional rooms for senior leaders.

NCP has a 216-member central committee. It has committees in most districts outside Dhaka, and also at metropolitan, upazila and thana levels.

Why so many new parties?

Professor Dil Rowshan Jinnat Ara Nazneen of Dhaka University’s Department of Political Science believes the country has no real need for so many political parties.

She told Prothom Alo that several motives may lie behind the surge. Those excluded over the past 16 years may be trying to enter politics again after the shift in circumstances, while others may be forming parties in pursuit of new influence or dominance.

She added that the public must remain vigilant about the ideals and intent behind these new parties: what they seek to implement and why they have been formed.

If you notice certain symptoms in yourself or a friend, it’s important to be cautious. Excessive anxiety can cause a racing heart, trembling hands and feet, or becoming startled easily. Some may feel persistently low, lose interest in everything, or cry without reason.

For some, insomnia becomes a daily struggle with difficulty falling asleep or waking up in the middle of night. Long study sessions can cause physical exhaustion that doesn’t go away even after rest. Concentration becomes harder. Some may withdraw from family and friends, preferring to spend time alone.

How to stay well
How to stay well
To maintain focus and mindfulness, you can practise the following:

Divide your study time. Create a proper routine. Decide in advance what to study and when.

Set small goals. Don’t try to finish everything in one day, aim for achievable targets.

Take regular breaks. Avoid studying non-stop. Take a 10-minute break after every hour if possible. You can also use the Pomodoro technique by studying with full concentration for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. But this break shouldn’t mean watching reels!

Practise deep breathing. Whenever you feel pressure, close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. You can learn breathing exercises from YouTube which can help calm the mind.

Get enough sleep. Six to seven hours of sleep each night is essential as sleep refreshes the brain.

Eat healthy. Avoid fast food. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Drink plenty of water and keep a bottle nearby.

Walk or exercise daily. Even a little exercise helps. It’s good for the body as well as the mind. Walking with friends also allows useful conversations about exam preparation.

Think positively. Keep telling yourself, I can do this. Believe in yourself.

What not to do
What not to do
Don’t compare yourself with friends or others. Everyone’s path and preparation are different.

Avoid studying new topics at the last moment. Don’t try to memorise new material right before the exam, rather revise what you’ve studied already.

Don’t spend excessive time on social media as it harms concentration.

Avoid too much caffeine for excess tea or coffee can disturb sleep and increase anxiety.

Don’t stay up too late. Waking up early for a morning walk is a better habit.

Never entertain negative thoughts like “Nothing will work out for me.”

On the day of the exam
On the day of the exam
Even with strong preparation, many students fail to perform their best at the exam due to lack of focus. If you can manage your mental pressure your thinking becomes clearer.

You can keep a cool head while tackling difficult questions. Your brain works faster, and it also becomes easier to recall the answers after seeing the questions.

Remember, it’s normal to feel nervous in the exam hall. But you can control that anxiety. Take deep breaths. Think positively. Under pressure, time may seem to pass too quickly, but a calm mind makes time management easier. Decide how much time to allocate to each question.

If a question feels difficult or you momentarily forget an answer, some students panic. A healthy mind helps you recover quickly from that frustration and refocus on the next question.

Addressing the election commission (EC), Kader Siddiqui said, “If you attempt to hold an election while excluding the majority of voters in Bangladesh, you will not be able to conduct that election properly. You must make every effort to ensure voters’ participation.”

He made the remarks today while taking part in the second phase of the EC’s dialogue with registered political parties ahead of the 13th Jatiya Sangsad (national parliament) election.

He made the remarks today while taking part in the second phase of the EC’s dialogue with registered political parties ahead of the 13th Jatiya Sangsad (national parliament) election.
The dialogue, held at the EC headquarters in Agargaon, Dhaka, was attended by chief election commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin, three other election commissioners, and representatives from five political parties.

During the discussion, Kader Siddiqui said, “As an elderly citizen and a freedom fighter, I wish to offer you my advice: if you attempt to hold an election while excluding the majority of Bangladesh’s voters, you will not be able to conduct that election well. You must make every effort to ensure voters can take part. The Awami League founded Bangladesh. If the Awami League is banned today, the Awami League will be banned… But the Awami League will certainly try to halt or disrupt the election. Some will do it foolishly; some will do it in a smart way.”

Stating that no one will even look towards a referendum on the election day, he added, “If the BNP says ‘no’, and if the Awami League cannot contest the election, a large segment of the population will not even look in that direction at all. Now we are hearing that the Jatiya Party must be banned… In 15 months, professor Yunus did not even for once consider us, the Krishak Sramik Janata League, as a political party. If everyone is kept outside in this way, there is no possibility whatsoever of holding an acceptable election.”

Questioning what the referendum is actually about, Kader Siddiqui said, “People of this country do not know what issue this referendum concerns. And yet four matters have been placed in this referendum. For all four the questions are simply ‘yes’ or ‘no’. If people disagree with two of the four questions, will voters be allowed to express their opinions on those two?”

"Frozen shrimp exports showing signs of recovery","https://en.prothomalo.com/business/local/woweny25vu","Published: 16 Nov 2025, 15: 42","After declining for two consecutive years, frozen shrimp exports are beginning to recover from the brink.

Frozen shrimp exports returned to a positive trend in the outgoing fiscal year.

In the first three months of the current fiscal year (July–September), frozen shrimp exports grew by nearly 22 per cent.

However, by the end of October, covering four months, the growth had slowed to 10 per cent.

Several exporters said that during the Russia-Ukraine war, high inflation led to reduced demand for Bagda shrimp in the global market, while lower-priced Vannamei shrimp saw higher demand worldwide.

At that time, commercially viable high-yield Bagda shrimp farming had not yet begun in Bangladesh, resulting in lower frozen shrimp exports. However, last year, demand and exports of Bagda shrimp began to increase again.

At that time, commercially viable high-yield Bagda shrimp farming had not yet begun in Bangladesh, resulting in lower frozen shrimp exports. However, last year, demand and exports of Bagda shrimp began to increase again.
Exporters further noted that while purchase orders remain strong, raw materials—particularly shrimp—are not being supplied in line with demand. Although small-scale Vannamei shrimp farming has started in the country, it is not yet being exported. As a result, it is unclear how sustainable the export growth will be in the future.

According to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), in the post-COVID fiscal year 2021-22, earnings from frozen shrimp exports increased by nearly 24 per cent, reaching $41 million. However, in the following year, exports plummeted due to the Russia-Ukraine war, falling to $30 million. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, exports further declined to around $25 million.

Nevertheless, thanks to increased purchase orders, exports rose by 19 per cent in the outgoing fiscal year, reaching $29.63 million.

In the first four months of the current fiscal year (July–October), $12 million worth of frozen shrimp has been exported. This represents an increase of nearly 10 per cent compared to the same period last year, when exports totaled $11 million.

Other major destinations included the Netherlands ($4.75 million), the United Kingdom ($4.5 million), Belgium ($4 million), Germany ($2.96 million), and the United States ($2 million) for frozen shrimp, crab, and squid.

Vannamei farming still lagging behind
Vannamei farming still lagging behind
For a long time, exporters have been negotiating with the government for permission to cultivate Vannamei shrimp in the country. Initially, the Department of Fisheries did not encourage or grant permission, citing potential adverse effects on the environment. Finally, in September 2019, the government allowed experimental cultivation of this shrimp. However, the process was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2021, experimental Vannamei shrimp farming began at the Lonapani Research Centre in Paikgachha Upazila, Khulna. The following year, eight institutions received experimental cultivation permits in the first phase, and later four more institutions were granted permission. Last year, various organisations started commercial production.

Initially, the Department of Fisheries did not encourage or grant permission, citing potential adverse effects on the environment. Finally, in September 2019, the government allowed experimental cultivation of this shrimp. However, the process was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2021, experimental Vannamei shrimp farming began at the Lonapani Research Centre in Paikgachha Upazila, Khulna. The following year, eight institutions received experimental cultivation permits in the first phase, and later four more institutions were granted permission. Last year, various organisations started commercial production.
Currently, high-yield Vannamei shrimp are being farmed intensively at a farm in Cox’s Bazar. Salahuddin Ahmed, quality control officer at the company Seemark (BD), said that this year, their farm exported 75 tonnes of Vannamei shrimp to the United Kingdom in three batches.

Leaders of the Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters’ Association (BFFEA) stated that currently, 50–60 small and medium-sized enterprises are cultivating Vannamei shrimp, and production is at a satisfactory level.

Shyamal Das, MD of MUC Foods, said, “Orders for Bagda shrimp are good. However, we are not receiving raw materials according to demand, so we cannot say whether export growth will be sustainable.” He added that production of Vannamei shrimp must be increased to make frozen shrimp exports sustainable.

Among the three, Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman are absconding. Both are currently staying in India.
The only arrested accused in the case, Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, has confessed and given testimony in the tribunal as an “approver” or state witness. In his statement, he said that then–Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had directly ordered the use of “lethal weapons” to suppress the anti-discrimination student movement. He received this order on 18 July last year through then–Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan.

According to the investigation report, on Sheikh Hasina’s orders, lethal weapons were used to kill 1,500 innocent, unarmed students and civilians and injure 30,000 people in July–August 2024.

During closing arguments, the prosecution sought the maximum punishment—death penalty—for Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman. They also requested that their properties be confiscated and transferred to the families of those killed in July and to the injured July fighters.

The prosecution also stated that former IGP Mamun has disclosed the full truth of the events as an approver, and the tribunal will issue the appropriate order in his regard. On the other hand, state-appointed defence lawyers have sought acquittal for Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman.

Five charges 
Five charges 
A total of five charges have been brought against ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina and two other accused in the case involving crimes against humanity committed during the July mass uprising.

The five charges are: delivering inciting speeches; ordering the use of lethal weapons to suppress and eliminate protesters; the shooting and killing of Abu Sayed, a student of Begum Rokeya University, Rangpur; the shooting and killing of six protesters in Dhaka’s Chankharpul area; burning six people to death in Ashulia.

At a briefing at the tribunal premises yesterday, Sunday, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar Hossain Tamim said they had been able to prove all five charges beyond reasonable doubt. In the interest of justice, the prosecution will accept whatever order the tribunal delivers.

He added that the portion of the judgment that the tribunal reads out will be broadcast live, subject to the tribunal’s permission.

Bangladesh Police’s National Central Bureau (NCB) had applied to the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) for issuing a Red Notice against Sheikh Hasina.

Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said that if the tribunal convicts Sheikh Hasina, the prosecution will submit another request to Interpol for a “conviction warrant” to facilitate issuing a Red Notice.

Sheikh Hasina cannot appeal while absconding
Sheikh Hasina cannot appeal while absconding
At the briefing, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said that if Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman are sentenced, they cannot appeal because they are absconding. The tribunal law clearly states that an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the verdict. But to seek an appeal, a convicted accused must surrender. If law enforcement arrests them, they would then have the right to appeal.

A journalist asked whether the chief accused, being a woman, would receive any special legal privileges.

In response, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said that under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), women, the sick, juveniles, boys, and children are given priority in matters of bail. But in handing down sentences, no separate privilege exists for women under general law or tribunal law. Therefore, whether the accused is a woman or a man, the punishment will depend on the gravity of the crime. If the charges are not proven, the accused will be acquitted.

Another journalist asked about Sheikh Hasina’s recent interviews, in which she said she did not order killings directly.

In reply, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said Sheikh Hasina can present everything by appearing before the tribunal. Statements made without appearing carry no legal basis. Her voice recordings were played in open court and broadcast, and in those recordings she is heard giving the order for use of lethal weapons. No one in the world accused of crimes against humanity has ever admitted guilt.

On whether Sheikh Hasina is able to give interviews to various media outlets while staying in India, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said the prosecution views this purely as a governmental and diplomatic matter. The prosecution is not taking her statements into account. The government will take action regarding her statements.

"Maulana Bhasani’s ‘Silence’","https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/op-ed/e7q3vhnepj","Published: 17 Nov 2025, 02: 27","The person we know as 'Maulana Bhasani' was not originally named that. Neither of these two words was part of his real name. Both 'Maulana' and 'Bhasani' were titles or epithets he acquired later. 'Maulana' reflected his religious faith and practice, while 'Bhasani' became a symbol of his struggle and rebellion. His life and activities were such that his real name faded behind these titles. In fact, his birth name was Abdul Hamid Khan, and his childhood nickname was Chaga, which was how he was known in his early years.

He had none of the wealth, status, or family influence that typically help in political and social establishment. Yet he drew from every experience in life—from traveling theatre troupes to the Deoband Madrasa. Among these experiences, the trait that ultimately made him remarkable was his deep connection with the masses. This connection allowed him to see life through the lens of the collective, linking his life with the lives of those around him.

He viewed imperialism, feudalism, and capitalism not from a distance, but through the experiences of oppressed people. He understood that poverty, helplessness, and a life of deprivation were not mere fate—they were created and sustained by specific causes, systems, and power structures.

This understanding set him apart from other maulanas and pirs. In a hypocritical world, he became solitary, while among the people he became a leader of the oppressed. He was not just a voice for Muslims; he became the voice for all oppressed people of the so-called Third World, regardless of religion, ethnicity, or gender.

He was not just a voice for Muslims; he became the voice for all oppressed people of the so-called Third World, regardless of religion, ethnicity, or gender.
In our society, religious leaders such as maulanas and pirs hold immense power. Rulers and exploiters always support them to maintain their own authority. At the same time, countless people approach these religious figures to cope with unbearable lives. People seek relief from ailments, protection for their children, divine help in crises, and safety from cruel oppressors through prayers, talismans, or charms. Where there is no money for treatment, no doctors, no medicine, and where people’s own strength is unclear; where rivers erode, and tyrants and the powerful commit oppression—the oppressed see no other way but to turn to such religious paths.

Most religious leaders take money, offer advice, and urge people to be patient, to endure, to accept their fate with satisfaction. Yet these leaders themselves remain bound to the very oppressors who are few in number but hold power. The dependence of religious leaders on oppressors, and of oppressors on religious certification, creates a vicious cycle in which they protect each other. For the oppressed, this produces a deadlock. Amid storms and aggressions, the only guidance offered to the battered people is religious practice and patience in this life for infinite rewards in the next. Such leaders’ teachings are thus often infused with power, misogyny, communalism, and other social toxins.

Maulana Bhasani: A leader of the oppressed 
Maulana Bhasani: A leader of the oppressed 
Maulana Bhasani was also a pir (spiritual guide). Millions of people were his disciples. Because he did not discriminate based on religion, caste, or gender, anyone could approach him. Men and women of different faiths, and especially poor people oppressed and exploited by landlords, moneylenders, and the ruling classes, came to him for help. Unlike many religious figures, Bhasani did not derive his income from their suffering. He offered prayers, charms, and spiritual guidance, but if someone was seriously ill, he advised them to see a doctor and even provided money for medicine if needed.

Unlike many religious figures, Bhasani did not derive his income from their suffering. He offered prayers, charms, and spiritual guidance, but if someone was seriously ill, he advised them to see a doctor and even provided money for medicine if needed.
What set Maulana Bhasani apart, and in some ways made him the opposite of other religious leaders, was his approach to injustice. People came to him for guidance and shared the indescribable hardships and injustices of their lives. Bhasani’s stance was that such suffering was not fate, not a divine decree, and above all, could be changed if people were united. This perspective drove him to adopt a rebellious position against injustice from his youth. For him, 'Rebellion against injustice is righteous' became another name for his life.

Bhasani’s life, speeches, and struggle angered the Pakistani state, dominated by the ownership of Islam, as well as military rulers, landlords, moneylenders, feudal lords, and their favoured religious leaders.
He was labeled a 'traitor to India', a 'lungi-clad Maulana', and even an 'apostate'. This hostility from rulers and oppressors was essentially a class-based resentment. In appearance, lifestyle, speech, and demeanor, Bhasani belonged to the lower class. Through struggle, he gave voice to the oppressed within Islam, standing against the elite interpretation of the faith. While religion was treated as a safe haven monopolised by rulers and oppressors, Bhasani challenged that sanctuary.

Injustice and suffering are not abstract, nor do they descend from some unknown planet. By observing these experiences with responsibility and sensitivity, one can uncover a vast truth: the causes of inhumane lives, the social structures, rules, and systems behind them. It becomes clear which classes and groups maintain and enforce these systems, using every means to perpetuate them—and religion is not exempt. The struggle for total liberation cannot be indefinite or aimless; it requires envisioning and working toward a society that can free people from this hellish condition.
Bhasani did not aim for the monarchy of Saudi Arabia; he envisioned a society liberated from exploitation, oppression, and inequality. He sought a social system that could bring people joy, dignity, and humanity. The struggle to establish such a society, he presented as a duty and responsibility to the people.

Therefore, to free people from injustice, oppression, and suffering, prayers alone are not enough; what is needed is the creation of collective struggle. This understanding enabled Maulana to become the symbol of resistance known as Bhasani. This Bhasani stood against the overwhelming power and aggression of all kinds of oppressors, channeling the voices of millions into his own, and confronting authority with the immense strength of the people. He gave tangible form to the limitless power rising from among the oppressed. His warnings against the oppressors not only revitalised weary, oppressed, and struggling people but also seemed to animate nature itself—'Silence!'

With this resolve, Maulana Bhasani participated in the 1971 Liberation War and, in the post-independence and disillusioned years, became a symbol of people’s despair and aspirations. He challenged the power of India’s ruling class and shook the country against the oppression at Farakka. Although his influence was undermined at times by the errors and impulsiveness of leftist leaders, and he himself faced moments of despair, his strengths and limitations both offer lessons for our struggle.

Fifty-four years after independence, at a time when the people of Bangladesh are facing setbacks contrary to the hopes of mass uprisings—confronted by imperialism, the multifaceted aggression of domestic and foreign rulers, plundering by various looter groups, confusion from the expansion of religious-fascist politics—Maulana Bhasani repeatedly emerges as a powerful voice for the liberation of the oppressed, challenging local and foreign tyrants, calling again and again: 'Silence!'

"Security tightened on expressway and Padma bridge, few vehicles on road","https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/6scgmag9r1","Published: 17 Nov 2025, 06: 17","Law enforcement agencies have intensified their activities on the Padma bridge and the Dhaka–Bhanga expressway in connection with the verdict in the crimes against humanity case against deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina.

Vehicular movement is continuing across the Padma bridge. Although vehicles are using the expressway, their numbers are noticeably lower.

According to Shariatpur district police sources, due to the ‘lockdown’ programme announced online by Awami League, whose activities are now banned, additional members of the law enforcement agencies have been deployed around the toll plaza on the Jajira side of the Padma bridge and along the Dhaka–Bhanga Expressway.

Faruk Ahmed Talukdar, president of the Shariatpur Bus Owners Association, told Prothom Alo that vehicles between Dhaka and Shariatpur have been operating since morning.

As a programme has been announced by a particular organisation, patrols have been increased to ensure the security of important infrastructure around the Padma bridge.

Superintendent of police, Nazrul Islam further stated, “Yesterday, Sunday, the home adviser made a brief stop while travelling to Dhaka. At that time, we exchanged courtesies.

"One in every two girls subjected to child marriage","https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/19igfi5dzc","Published: 17 Nov 2025, 03: 05","The rate of child marriage among girls under 18 has fallen from 60 per cent to 56 per cent, but the situation remains high, with one in every two girls in the country still subjected to child marriage. Compared to 2019, this rate has decreased by 4 per cent.

Institutional deliveries, meaning births at health facilities or hospitals, have increased. Alongside this, the rate of births by caesarean section (C-section) has also risen. Mortality among children from birth up to under five years of age has decreased. Child labour and the proportion of out-of-school children have risen.

The figures came up in the newly published Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) report by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and UNICEF. The survey report was released today, Sunday, at the China–Bangladesh Friendship Conference Centre in Agargaon, Dhaka.

The report states that the survey was conducted in two phases from January to June this year, covering nearly 63,000 households. It included 172 indicators and 27 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indices, aligned with national priorities and global standards.

For the first time, the survey included tests for anaemia among pregnant women and children, as well as levels of heavy metal contamination including cadmium. The previous MICS report was published in 2019, and the new report also presents a comparative picture showing how much progress or decline has occurred since then.

The event was chaired by BBS director general Mohammad Mizanur Rahman. As special guests, Aleya Akter, Secretary of the Statistics and Information Management Division, attended, and UNICEF Bangladesh representative Rana Flowers was present as a distinguished guest.

Rana Flowers said that the rates of child marriage and child mortality demonstrate that progress is possible. Crises such as heavy metal contamination and child labour are depriving millions of children of their potential. Investment in child protection must be increased.

The welcome speech at the event was delivered by Mohammad Masud Rana Chowdhury. Emdadul Haque, the focal point officer of MICS, presented the main findings of the report. The open discussion session was conducted by BBS deputy director Md Alamgir Hossain.

The survey report provides two sets of data on child marriage. Before turning 18, 47 per cent of women aged 20–24 were married, whereas this rate was 51 per cent in the 2019 report. Meanwhile, the nationwide rate of child marriage among girls under 18 has stood at 56 per cent, which was previously 60 per cent.

The rate of childbirth among adolescent mothers has risen from 83 to 92 per thousand. Compared with 2019, caesarean (C-section) deliveries have increased by 16 per cent to nearly 52 per cent. Institutional deliveries at healthcare facilities or hospitals have increased by 18 per cent to 71 per cent.

Institutional deliveries at healthcare facilities or hospitals have increased by 18 per cent to 71 per cent.
Child labour has risen by more than 2 per cent to 9 per cent. The share of school-age children not attending secondary school has increased by 2 per cent to nearly 34 per cent. Use of contraceptives has dropped by 5 per cent to 58 per cent. The total fertility rate (TFR) has increased from 2.3 to 2.4.

While moderating the panel discussion at the event, former adviser to the caretaker government Hossain Zillur Rahman said that this MICS report is an important step towards open data. The data should be easily accessible so that it can be discussed on a wider scale. Two sets of data have come regarding child marriage. The question remains as to which one should be used in policymaking. The underlying stories behind why the rate is rising in some areas and falling in others should come out. The quality of the survey needs to be improved.

The speakers emphasised reducing the disparity between urban and rural areas in the supply of safe water. They urged the government to strengthen monitoring to reduce the high rate of C-sections. Apart from this, four more panel discussions were held at the event.

The report said child mortality declined across all five age-specific groups under five. Among children under five, 33 out of every 1,000 live births die, down from the previous rate of 40 per 1,000.

The rate of stunted children fell to 24 per cent. However, the rate of wasted children rose by 3 per cent to about 13 per cent. The share of underweight children increased slightly to 23 per cent, while the rate of overweight children declined somewhat.

The rate of receiving four antenatal care visits stands at 43 per cent. The proportion of women who received at least one antenatal care visit has increased from 58 to nearly 76 per cent. However, the rate of receiving the full four quality visits remains low at just 43 per cent.

Among children under five, only 59 per cent have birth registration. As a result, many children are deprived of legal identity and access to services.

The new survey results show that 38 per cent of children aged 12–59 months and nearly 8 per cent of pregnant women have cadmium levels in their blood above safe limits. Dhaka (65 per cent) is the most affected area. Cadmium contamination poses a threat to children’s brain development, affecting all socioeconomic groups. More than half of the affected children belong to wealthy households, while 30 per cent belong to poor communities. Nearly half of drinking water sources and over 80 per cent of household water samples are contaminated with E. coli bacteria. The report highlights issues of safe water, sanitation, and the rising rate of school absenteeism among children.

According to Prothom Alo’s tally, at least 26 political parties have emerged in the 15 months following the July mass uprising. Six of those parties have the word “janata” (people) in their names in some form. Launching of most of the political parties were announced through press conferences at the National Press Club; a few held their events at the Central Shaheed Minar, while one party was announced by organising a procession on the Dhaka University campus.

Speaking at his office on the afternoon of 26 October, party chairman Sirajul Islam told Prothom Alo that he launched the party because “One has to vote for some party. I don’t like any of them. I formed the Janapriya Party so that I could vote for my own party.”

On 25 October, this correspondent met him on Topkhana Road. He said he could not rent an office for the party due to financial constraints. That is why he sits at a labour federation office, which has been provided in the application to the EC for registration.

Hanif Bangladeshi said, “I marched on foot from Teknaf to Tetulia in 2018 demanding voting rights, democracy and the rule of law. I even staged a march to the home of Felani with a symbolic dead body in protest against border killings.”

Asked why he floated a political party, he said existing parties fail to honour their promises made to the people. Besides, it was hard to move ahead without an organisation.

The Bangladesh United Party was launched on 28 October. At the press conference, its chairman, Md Zakir Hossain, said the party has committees in at least 20 districts and over 100 upazilas.
However, only 60–70 people attended the event, including 20–25 journalists and YouTubers. Asked why attendance was so low if the party had so many committees, Zakir Hossain told Prothom Alo, “I do not see any need to bring everyone to Dhaka. It only increases traffic congestion.”

Earlier, on 26 April, the Bangladesh Notun Dhaka Janatar Party was launched at the National Press Club. On 7 November, when Prothom Alo requested the party’s office address, its convener Muhammad Abdul Ahad said it was located on the 6th floor of Darus Salam Bhaban in Purana Paltan.

However, only 60–70 people attended the event, including 20–25 journalists and YouTubers. Asked why attendance was so low if the party had so many committees, Zakir Hossain told Prothom Alo, “I do not see any need to bring everyone to Dhaka. It only increases traffic congestion.”

Earlier, on 26 April, the Bangladesh Notun Dhaka Janatar Party was launched at the National Press Club. On 7 November, when Prothom Alo requested the party’s office address, its convener Muhammad Abdul Ahad said it was located on the 6th floor of Darus Salam Bhaban in Purana Paltan. But a visit the next day found that the office actually belonged to a newspaper called Desher Dak.

When contacted again, Abdul Ahad said, “After forming the party, we temporarily used that office. But renting an office costs money, which we do not yet have. We are now looking for a small place.”

Uprising-themed graffiti inside party office 
Of the 26 new parties, only NCP has a large, well-equipped office on the 16th floor of Rupayan Tower at Banglamotor in the capital. The walls are decorated with graffiti referencing the mass uprising. The office includes modern facilities for press conferences and meetings, separate rooms for the convener and member secretary, and additional rooms for senior leaders.

NCP has a 216-member central committee. It has committees in most districts outside Dhaka, and also at metropolitan, upazila and thana levels.

Why so many new parties?

Professor Dil Rowshan Jinnat Ara Nazneen of Dhaka University’s Department of Political Science believes the country has no real need for so many political parties.

She told Prothom Alo that several motives may lie behind the surge. Those excluded over the past 16 years may be trying to enter politics again after the shift in circumstances, while others may be forming parties in pursuit of new influence or dominance.

She added that the public must remain vigilant about the ideals and intent behind these new parties: what they seek to implement and why they have been formed.

If you notice certain symptoms in yourself or a friend, it’s important to be cautious. Excessive anxiety can cause a racing heart, trembling hands and feet, or becoming startled easily. Some may feel persistently low, lose interest in everything, or cry without reason.

For some, insomnia becomes a daily struggle with difficulty falling asleep or waking up in the middle of night. Long study sessions can cause physical exhaustion that doesn’t go away even after rest. Concentration becomes harder. Some may withdraw from family and friends, preferring to spend time alone.

How to stay well
How to stay well
To maintain focus and mindfulness, you can practise the following:

Divide your study time. Create a proper routine. Decide in advance what to study and when.

Set small goals. Don’t try to finish everything in one day, aim for achievable targets.

Take regular breaks. Avoid studying non-stop. Take a 10-minute break after every hour if possible. You can also use the Pomodoro technique by studying with full concentration for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. But this break shouldn’t mean watching reels!

Practise deep breathing. Whenever you feel pressure, close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. You can learn breathing exercises from YouTube which can help calm the mind.

Get enough sleep. Six to seven hours of sleep each night is essential as sleep refreshes the brain.

Eat healthy. Avoid fast food. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Drink plenty of water and keep a bottle nearby.

Walk or exercise daily. Even a little exercise helps. It’s good for the body as well as the mind. Walking with friends also allows useful conversations about exam preparation.

Think positively. Keep telling yourself, I can do this. Believe in yourself.

What not to do
What not to do
Don’t compare yourself with friends or others. Everyone’s path and preparation are different.

Avoid studying new topics at the last moment. Don’t try to memorise new material right before the exam, rather revise what you’ve studied already.

Don’t spend excessive time on social media as it harms concentration.

Avoid too much caffeine for excess tea or coffee can disturb sleep and increase anxiety.

Don’t stay up too late. Waking up early for a morning walk is a better habit.

Never entertain negative thoughts like “Nothing will work out for me.”

On the day of the exam
On the day of the exam
Even with strong preparation, many students fail to perform their best at the exam due to lack of focus. If you can manage your mental pressure your thinking becomes clearer.

You can keep a cool head while tackling difficult questions. Your brain works faster, and it also becomes easier to recall the answers after seeing the questions.

Remember, it’s normal to feel nervous in the exam hall. But you can control that anxiety. Take deep breaths. Think positively. Under pressure, time may seem to pass too quickly, but a calm mind makes time management easier. Decide how much time to allocate to each question.

If a question feels difficult or you momentarily forget an answer, some students panic. A healthy mind helps you recover quickly from that frustration and refocus on the next question.

Addressing the election commission (EC), Kader Siddiqui said, “If you attempt to hold an election while excluding the majority of voters in Bangladesh, you will not be able to conduct that election properly. You must make every effort to ensure voters’ participation.”

He made the remarks today while taking part in the second phase of the EC’s dialogue with registered political parties ahead of the 13th Jatiya Sangsad (national parliament) election.
The dialogue, held at the EC headquarters in Agargaon, Dhaka, was attended by chief election commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin, three other election commissioners, and representatives from five political parties.

During the discussion, Kader Siddiqui said, “As an elderly citizen and a freedom fighter, I wish to offer you my advice: if you attempt to hold an election while excluding the majority of Bangladesh’s voters, you will not be able to conduct that election well. You must make every effort to ensure voters can take part. The Awami League founded Bangladesh. If the Awami League is banned today, the Awami League will be banned… But the Awami League will certainly try to halt or disrupt the election. Some will do it foolishly; some will do it in a smart way.”

Stating that no one will even look towards a referendum on the election day, he added, “If the BNP says ‘no’, and if the Awami League cannot contest the election, a large segment of the population will not even look in that direction at all. Now we are hearing that the Jatiya Party must be banned… In 15 months, professor Yunus did not even for once consider us, the Krishak Sramik Janata League, as a political party. If everyone is kept outside in this way, there is no possibility whatsoever of holding an acceptable election.”

If people disagree with two of the four questions, will voters be allowed to express their opinions on those two?”

"Frozen shrimp exports showing signs of recovery","https://en.prothomalo.com/business/local/woweny25vu","Published: 16 Nov 2025, 15: 42","After declining for two consecutive years, frozen shrimp exports are beginning to recover from the brink.

Frozen shrimp exports returned to a positive trend in the outgoing fiscal year.

In the first three months of the current fiscal year (July–September), frozen shrimp exports grew by nearly 22 per cent.

However, by the end of October, covering four months, the growth had slowed to 10 per cent.

Several exporters said that during the Russia-Ukraine war, high inflation led to reduced demand for Bagda shrimp in the global market, while lower-priced Vannamei shrimp saw higher demand worldwide.

At that time, commercially viable high-yield Bagda shrimp farming had not yet begun in Bangladesh, resulting in lower frozen shrimp exports. However, last year, demand and exports of Bagda shrimp began to increase again.

At that time, commercially viable high-yield Bagda shrimp farming had not yet begun in Bangladesh, resulting in lower frozen shrimp exports. However, last year, demand and exports of Bagda shrimp began to increase again.
Exporters further noted that while purchase orders remain strong, raw materials—particularly shrimp—are not being supplied in line with demand. Although small-scale Vannamei shrimp farming has started in the country, it is not yet being exported. As a result, it is unclear how sustainable the export growth will be in the future.

According to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), in the post-COVID fiscal year 2021-22, earnings from frozen shrimp exports increased by nearly 24 per cent, reaching $41 million. However, in the following year, exports plummeted due to the Russia-Ukraine war, falling to $30 million. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, exports further declined to around $25 million.

Nevertheless, thanks to increased purchase orders, exports rose by 19 per cent in the outgoing fiscal year, reaching $29.63 million.

In the first four months of the current fiscal year (July–October), $12 million worth of frozen shrimp has been exported. This represents an increase of nearly 10 per cent compared to the same period last year, when exports totaled $11 million.

In the first four months of the current fiscal year (July–October), $12 million worth of frozen shrimp has been exported. This represents an increase of nearly 10 per cent compared to the same period last year, when exports totaled $11 million.
In the 2022-23 fiscal year, the top five destinations for Bangladesh’s frozen shrimp, crab, and squid exports were the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States. In the outgoing fiscal year, China emerged as the top destination, with exports worth $5.66 million. Other major destinations included the Netherlands ($4.75 million), the United Kingdom ($4.5 million), Belgium ($4 million), Germany ($2.96 million), and the United States ($2 million) for frozen shrimp, crab, and squid.

Vannamei farming still lagging behind

For a long time, exporters have been negotiating with the government for permission to cultivate Vannamei shrimp in the country. Initially, the Department of Fisheries did not encourage or grant permission, citing potential adverse effects on the environment. Finally, in September 2019, the government allowed experimental cultivation of this shrimp. However, the process was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2021, experimental Vannamei shrimp farming began at the Lonapani Research Centre in Paikgachha Upazila, Khulna. The following year, eight institutions received experimental cultivation permits in the first phase, and later four more institutions were granted permission. Last year, various organisations started commercial production.

Currently, high-yield Vannamei shrimp are being farmed intensively at a farm in Cox’s Bazar. Salahuddin Ahmed, quality control officer at the company Seemark (BD), said that this year, their farm exported 75 tonnes of Vannamei shrimp to the United Kingdom in three batches.

Leaders of the Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters’ Association (BFFEA) stated that currently, 50–60 small and medium-sized enterprises are cultivating Vannamei shrimp, and production is at a satisfactory level.

Shyamal Das, MD of MUC Foods, said, “Orders for Bagda shrimp are good. However, we are not receiving raw materials according to demand, so we cannot say whether export growth will be sustainable.” He added that production of Vannamei shrimp must be increased to make frozen shrimp exports sustainable.

Among the three, Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman are absconding. Both are currently staying in India.
The only arrested accused in the case, Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, has confessed and given testimony in the tribunal as an “approver” or state witness. In his statement, he said that then–Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had directly ordered the use of “lethal weapons” to suppress the anti-discrimination student movement. He received this order on 18 July last year through then–Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan.

According to the investigation report, on Sheikh Hasina’s orders, lethal weapons were used to kill 1,500 innocent, unarmed students and civilians and injure 30,000 people in July–August 2024.

During closing arguments, the prosecution sought the maximum punishment—death penalty—for Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman. They also requested that their properties be confiscated and transferred to the families of those killed in July and to the injured July fighters.

The prosecution also stated that former IGP Mamun has disclosed the full truth of the events as an approver, and the tribunal will issue the appropriate order in his regard. On the other hand, state-appointed defence lawyers have sought acquittal for Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman.

Five charges 
Five charges 
A total of five charges have been brought against ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina and two other accused in the case involving crimes against humanity committed during the July mass uprising.

The five charges are: delivering inciting speeches; ordering the use of lethal weapons to suppress and eliminate protesters; the shooting and killing of Abu Sayed, a student of Begum Rokeya University, Rangpur; the shooting and killing of six protesters in Dhaka’s Chankharpul area; burning six people to death in Ashulia.

At a briefing at the tribunal premises yesterday, Sunday, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar Hossain Tamim said they had been able to prove all five charges beyond reasonable doubt. In the interest of justice, the prosecution will accept whatever order the tribunal delivers.

He added that the portion of the judgment that the tribunal reads out will be broadcast live, subject to the tribunal’s permission.

Bangladesh Police’s National Central Bureau (NCB) had applied to the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) for issuing a Red Notice against Sheikh Hasina.

Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said that if the tribunal convicts Sheikh Hasina, the prosecution will submit another request to Interpol for a “conviction warrant” to facilitate issuing a Red Notice.

Sheikh Hasina cannot appeal while absconding
Sheikh Hasina cannot appeal while absconding
At the briefing, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said that if Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman are sentenced, they cannot appeal because they are absconding. The tribunal law clearly states that an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the verdict. But to seek an appeal, a convicted accused must surrender. If law enforcement arrests them, they would then have the right to appeal.

A journalist asked whether the chief accused, being a woman, would receive any special legal privileges.

In response, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said that under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), women, the sick, juveniles, boys, and children are given priority in matters of bail. But in handing down sentences, no separate privilege exists for women under general law or tribunal law. Therefore, whether the accused is a woman or a man, the punishment will depend on the gravity of the crime. If the charges are not proven, the accused will be acquitted.

Another journalist asked about Sheikh Hasina’s recent interviews, in which she said she did not order killings directly.

In reply, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said Sheikh Hasina can present everything by appearing before the tribunal. Statements made without appearing carry no legal basis. Her voice recordings were played in open court and broadcast, and in those recordings she is heard giving the order for use of lethal weapons. No one in the world accused of crimes against humanity has ever admitted guilt.

On whether Sheikh Hasina is able to give interviews to various media outlets while staying in India, Prosecutor Gazi Monowar said the prosecution views this purely as a governmental and diplomatic matter. The prosecution is not taking her statements into account. The government will take action regarding her statements.

Any exam puts us under pressure. When stressed, candidates may experience various issues. Worry and anxiety are especially common. What if I don’t get in anywhere? What will my parents say? What will happen to my future? All these thoughts arise naturally.

You may struggle to concentrate on your studies. Studying for long stretches can feel difficult.
Thoughts like “my friends are doing better”, “they’re studying at better coaching centres”, “they’re scoring high in model tests” may come to mind. This comparison increases pressure. Parents sometimes unintentionally add to the stress by comparing their children with others.

Many students face sleeping problems during this time. They may have trouble falling asleep, feel physically exhausted, or stay up late using their laptop or phone, which also disrupts sleep.

Mood may become irritable. You might get angry over small issues or become discouraged easily.

Mental stress can manifest physically through headaches, stomach issues, loss of appetite, etc.

Warning signs to look out for
Warning signs to look out for
If you notice certain symptoms in yourself or a friend, it’s important to be cautious. Excessive anxiety can cause a racing heart, trembling hands and feet, or becoming startled easily. Some may feel persistently low, lose interest in everything, or cry without reason.

For some, insomnia becomes a daily struggle with difficulty falling asleep or waking up in the middle of night. Long study sessions can cause physical exhaustion that doesn’t go away even after rest. Concentration becomes harder. Some may withdraw from family and friends, preferring to spend time alone.

How to stay well
How to stay well
To maintain focus and mindfulness, you can practise the following:

Divide your study time. Create a proper routine. Decide in advance what to study and when.

Set small goals. Don’t try to finish everything in one day, aim for achievable targets.

Take regular breaks. Avoid studying non-stop. Take a 10-minute break after every hour if possible. You can also use the Pomodoro technique by studying with full concentration for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. But this break shouldn’t mean watching reels!

Practise deep breathing. Whenever you feel pressure, close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. You can learn breathing exercises from YouTube which can help calm the mind.

Get enough sleep. Six to seven hours of sleep each night is essential as sleep refreshes the brain.

Eat healthy. Avoid fast food. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Drink plenty of water and keep a bottle nearby.

Walk or exercise daily. Even a little exercise helps. It’s good for the body as well as the mind. Walking with friends also allows useful conversations about exam preparation.

Think positively. Keep telling yourself, I can do this. Believe in yourself.

What not to do
What not to do
Don’t compare yourself with friends or others. Everyone’s path and preparation are different.

Avoid studying new topics at the last moment. Don’t try to memorise new material right before the exam, rather revise what you’ve studied already.

Don’t spend excessive time on social media as it harms concentration.

Avoid too much caffeine for excess tea or coffee can disturb sleep and increase anxiety.

Don’t stay up too late. Waking up early for a morning walk is a better habit.

Never entertain negative thoughts like “Nothing will work out for me.”

On the day of the exam
On the day of the exam
Even with strong preparation, many students fail to perform their best at the exam due to lack of focus. If you can manage your mental pressure your thinking becomes clearer.

You can keep a cool head while tackling difficult questions. Your brain works faster, and it also becomes easier to recall the answers after seeing the questions.

Remember, it’s normal to feel nervous in the exam hall. But you can control that anxiety. Take deep breaths. Think positively. Under pressure, time may seem to pass too quickly, but a calm mind makes time management easier. Decide how much time to allocate to each question.

If a question feels difficult or you momentarily forget an answer, some students panic. A healthy mind helps you recover quickly from that frustration and refocus on the next question.

"Election cannot be conducted properly by excluding majority of voters: Kader Siddiqui to EC","https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/zc0sgsijfu","Published: 16 Nov 2025, 16: 17","Bangladesh’s majority of voters cannot be kept outside the electoral process if a proper election is to be held, Bangabir Kader Siddiqui, president of the Krishak Sramik Janata League said on Sunday.

Addressing the election commission (EC), Kader Siddiqui said, “If you attempt to hold an election while excluding the majority of voters in Bangladesh, you will not be able to conduct that election properly. You must make every effort to ensure voters’ participation.”

He made the remarks today while taking part in the second phase of the EC’s dialogue with registered political parties ahead of the 13th Jatiya Sangsad (national parliament) election.
Bangladesh’s majority of voters cannot be kept outside the electoral process if a proper election is to be held, Bangabir Kader Siddiqui, president of the Krishak Sramik Janata League said on Sunday.

Addressing the election commission (EC), Kader Siddiqui said, “If you attempt to hold an election while excluding the majority of voters in Bangladesh, you will not be able to conduct that election properly. You must make every effort to ensure voters’ participation.”

He made the remarks today while taking part in the second phase of the EC’s dialogue with registered political parties ahead of the 13th Jatiya Sangsad (national parliament) election.
The dialogue, held at the EC headquarters in Agargaon, Dhaka, was attended by chief election commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin, three other election commissioners, and representatives from five political parties.

During the discussion, Kader Siddiqui said, “As an elderly citizen and a freedom fighter, I wish to offer you my advice: if you attempt to hold an election while excluding the majority of Bangladesh’s voters, you will not be able to conduct that election well. You must make every effort to ensure voters can take part. The Awami League founded Bangladesh. If the Awami League is banned today, the Awami League will be banned… But the Awami League will certainly try to halt or disrupt the election. Some will do it foolishly; some will do it in a smart way.”

Stating that no one will even look towards a referendum on the election day, he added, “If the BNP says ‘no’, and if the Awami League cannot contest the election, a large segment of the population will not even look in that direction at all. Now we are hearing that the Jatiya Party must be banned… In 15 months, professor Yunus did not even for once consider us, the Krishak Sramik Janata League, as a political party. If everyone is kept outside in this way, there is no possibility whatsoever of holding an acceptable election.”

Questioning what the referendum is actually about, Kader Siddiqui said, “People of this country do not know what issue this referendum concerns. And yet four matters have been placed in this referendum. For all four the questions are simply ‘yes’ or ‘no’. If people disagree with two of the four questions, will voters be allowed to express their opinions on those two?”

“Sheikh Hasina says she will now re-establish democracy! It pains me to say this, but for the past three terms people could not cast their vote… When Allah becomes displeased enough with a ruler to unseat them, my sister Sheikh Hasina had met that measure in full. She lost power because of divine wrath. I will offer my gratitude for a thousand years to those who rose in the July Movement. But their subsequent actions have not been good,” Kader Siddiqui stated.

"Frozen shrimp exports showing signs of recovery","https://en.prothomalo.com/business/local/woweny25vu","Published: 16 Nov 2025, 15: 42","After declining for two consecutive years, frozen shrimp exports are beginning to recover from the brink.

Frozen shrimp exports returned to a positive trend in the outgoing fiscal year.

In the first three months of the current fiscal year (July–September), frozen shrimp exports grew by nearly 22 per cent.

However, by the end of October, covering four months, the growth had slowed to 10 per cent.

Several exporters said that during the Russia-Ukraine war, high inflation led to reduced demand for Bagda shrimp in the global market, while lower-priced Vannamei shrimp saw higher demand worldwide.

At that time, commercially viable high-yield Bagda shrimp farming had not yet begun in Bangladesh, resulting in lower frozen shrimp exports. However, last year, demand and exports of Bagda shrimp began to increase again.

At that time, commercially viable high-yield Bagda shrimp farming had not yet begun in Bangladesh, resulting in lower frozen shrimp exports. However, last year, demand and exports of Bagda shrimp began to increase again.
Exporters further noted that while purchase orders remain strong, raw materials—particularly shrimp—are not being supplied in line with demand. Although small-scale Vannamei shrimp farming has started in the country, it is not yet being exported. As a result, it is unclear how sustainable the export growth will be in the future.

According to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), in the post-COVID fiscal year 2021-22, earnings from frozen shrimp exports increased by nearly 24 per cent, reaching $41 million. However, in the following year, exports plummeted due to the Russia-Ukraine war, falling to $30 million. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, exports further declined to around $25 million.

Nevertheless, thanks to increased purchase orders, exports rose by 19 per cent in the outgoing fiscal year, reaching $29.63 million.

In the first four months of the current fiscal year (July–October), $12 million worth of frozen shrimp has been exported. This represents an increase of nearly 10 per cent compared to the same period last year, when exports totaled $11 million.

In the outgoing fiscal year, China emerged as the top destination, with exports worth $5.66 million. Other major destinations included the Netherlands ($4.75 million), the United Kingdom ($4.5 million), Belgium ($4 million), Germany ($2.96 million), and the United States ($2 million) for frozen shrimp, crab, and squid.

Vannamei farming still lagging behind
Vannamei farming still lagging behind
For a long time, exporters have been negotiating with the government for permission to cultivate Vannamei shrimp in the country. Initially, the Department of Fisheries did not encourage or grant permission, citing potential adverse effects on the environment. Finally, in September 2019, the government allowed experimental cultivation of this shrimp. However, the process was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2021, experimental Vannamei shrimp farming began at the Lonapani Research Centre in Paikgachha Upazila, Khulna. The following year, eight institutions received experimental cultivation permits in the first phase, and later four more institutions were granted permission. Last year, various organisations started commercial production.

Currently, high-yield Vannamei shrimp are being farmed intensively at a farm in Cox’s Bazar. Salahuddin Ahmed, quality control officer at the company Seemark (BD), said that this year, their farm exported 75 tonnes of Vannamei shrimp to the United Kingdom in three batches.

Leaders of the Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters’ Association (BFFEA) stated that currently, 50–60 small and medium-sized enterprises are cultivating Vannamei shrimp, and production is at a satisfactory level.

Shyamal Das, MD of MUC Foods, said, “Orders for Bagda shrimp are good. However, we are not receiving raw materials according to demand, so we cannot say whether export growth will be sustainable.” He added that production of Vannamei shrimp must be increased to make frozen shrimp exports sustainable.

"One in every two girls subjected to child marriage","https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/19igfi5dzc","Published: 17 Nov 2025, 03: 05","The rate of child marriage among girls under 18 has fallen from 60 per cent to 56 per cent, but the situation remains high, with one in every two girls in the country still subjected to child marriage. Compared to 2019, this rate has decreased by 4 per cent.

Institutional deliveries, meaning births at health facilities or hospitals, have increased. Alongside this, the rate of births by caesarean section (C-section) has also risen. Mortality among children from birth up to under five years of age has decreased. Child labour and the proportion of out-of-school children have risen.

The figures came up in the newly published Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) report by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and UNICEF. The survey report was released today, Sunday, at the China–Bangladesh Friendship Conference Centre in Agargaon, Dhaka.

The report states that the survey was conducted in two phases from January to June this year, covering nearly 63,000 households. It included 172 indicators and 27 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indices, aligned with national priorities and global standards.

For the first time, the survey included tests for anaemia among pregnant women and children, as well as levels of heavy metal contamination including cadmium. The previous MICS report was published in 2019, and the new report also presents a comparative picture showing how much progress or decline has occurred since then.

Rana Flowers said that the rates of child marriage and child mortality demonstrate that progress is possible. Crises such as heavy metal contamination and child labour are depriving millions of children of their potential. Investment in child protection must be increased.

The welcome speech at the event was delivered by Mohammad Masud Rana Chowdhury. Emdadul Haque, the focal point officer of MICS, presented the main findings of the report. The open discussion session was conducted by BBS deputy director Md Alamgir Hossain.

Child labour has risen by more than 2 per cent to 9 per cent. The share of school-age children not attending secondary school has increased by 2 per cent to nearly 34 per cent. Use of contraceptives has dropped by 5 per cent to 58 per cent. The total fertility rate (TFR) has increased from 2.3 to 2.4.

While moderating the panel discussion at the event, former adviser to the caretaker government Hossain Zillur Rahman said that this MICS report is an important step towards open data. The data should be easily accessible so that it can be discussed on a wider scale. Two sets of data have come regarding child marriage. The question remains as to which one should be used in policymaking. The underlying stories behind why the rate is rising in some areas and falling in others should come out.

Among children under five, only 59 per cent have birth registration. As a result, many children are deprived of legal identity and access to services.

The new survey results show that 38 per cent of children aged 12–59 months and nearly 8 per cent of pregnant women have cadmium levels in their blood above safe limits. Dhaka (65 per cent) is the most affected area. Cadmium contamination poses a threat to children’s brain development, affecting all socioeconomic groups. More than half of the affected children belong to wealthy households, while 30 per cent belong to poor communities. Nearly half of drinking water sources and over 80 per cent of household water samples are contaminated with E. coli bacteria. The report highlights issues of safe water, sanitation, and the rising rate of school absenteeism among children.

"26 new political parties launched in last 15 months","https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/q702up11jp","Published: 17 Nov 2025, 02: 26","The name of the political party is the Samata Party. It was launched on 21 September 2024. That day, around 30 people gathered in front of the National Press Club in Dhaka, most of them holding posters bearing the party’s name.

Asked why a new party was necessary, its leaders said that no political party fulfils the promises it makes to the public, and therefore…

Exactly one year after the Samata Party’s launching, the People’s Power Party was formed out of a desire to “do something for the country”. Leaders of this party have introduced themselves as “guardians of sovereignty”. At its launch on 27 September at the National Press Club, it was announced that the party has an 11-member advisory committee. However, the organisers could not produce a full list of advisers that day.

According to Prothom Alo’s tally, at least 26 political parties have emerged in the 15 months following the July mass uprising. Six of those parties have the word “janata” (people) in their names in some form. Launching of most of the political parties were announced through press conferences at the National Press Club; a few held their events at the Central Shaheed Minar, while one party was announced by organising a procession on the Dhaka University campus.

The most recent new political party, launched on 28 October, is the “Bangladesh United Party”.
The name of the political party is the Samata Party. It was launched on 21 September 2024. That day, around 30 people gathered in front of the National Press Club in Dhaka, most of them holding posters bearing the party’s name.

Asked why a new party was necessary, its leaders said that no political party fulfils the promises it makes to the public, and therefore…

Exactly one year after the Samata Party’s launching, the People’s Power Party was formed out of a desire to “do something for the country”. Leaders of this party have introduced themselves as “guardians of sovereignty”. At its launch on 27 September at the National Press Club, it was announced that the party has an 11-member advisory committee. However, the organisers could not produce a full list of advisers that day.

According to Prothom Alo’s tally, at least 26 political parties have emerged in the 15 months following the July mass uprising. Six of those parties have the word “janata” (people) in their names in some form. Launching of most of the political parties were announced through press conferences at the National Press Club; a few held their events at the Central Shaheed Minar, while one party was announced by organising a procession on the Dhaka University campus.

The most recent new political party, launched on 28 October, is the “Bangladesh United Party”.
The others parties formed between August last year and 27 October this year are: Janata Party Bangladesh; Nucleus Party of Bangladesh (NPB); World Muslim Community; Bangladesh Janopriya Party (BPP); Sarbobhoumotto Andolan; Bangladesh Sanskarbadi Party (BRP); Bangladesh Jagrata Party; Bangladesh Ganatantrik Party; Jatiya Biplobi Parishad; Bangladesh Social Democratic Party (BSDP); Bangladesh Jano-Odhikar Party; Amjanatar Dal; Bangladesh Ganatantrik Shakti; Desh Janata Party; Janatar Dal; Ganatantrik Nagorik Shakti; Bhasani Janashakti Party; Bangladesh Notun Dhara Janatar Party; People’s Power Party; Bangladesh Republic Party; Janatar Bangladesh Party; Natun Bangladesh Party; Bangladesh Samata Party; Bangladesh Amjanagan Party; and the National Citizen Party (NCP), founded by the young leaders of the July uprising.

There are currently 54 registered political parties with the election commission (EC),; however, the Bangladesh Awami League’s registration is suspended for now. The EC is preparing to register three more parties, two of which, NCP and Bangladesh Amjanagan Party, are among the 26 new ones. Nineteen of the newly formed parties applied to the EC for registration.

Among the newly launched parties, three—NCP, Bhasani Janashakti Party and Amjanatar Dal—were invited to the signing ceremony of the July National Charter on 17 October. Of these, NCP is yet to sign the charter.

Prothom Alo contacted all 26 new parties. Between 25 October and 8 November, two correspondents visited the offices of 15 of them. Most, apart from the NCP, operate from one or two rooms. Four of the remaining 11, Natun Bangladesh Party, Bangladesh Samata Party, Notun Dhara Janatar Party and Jatiya Biplobi Parishad could not be found at the addresses listed.

Bangladesh Janapriya Party operates from a two-room office on the 4th floor of an old building near Shapla Chattar in Motijheel in Dhaka. The space previously housed a tea-trading business. After incurring losses in that business, Md Sirajul Islam formed a new political party. He himself is the chairman of the party, launched on 23 September last year through a media conference at the National Press Club.

Speaking at his office on the afternoon of 26 October, party chairman Sirajul Islam told Prothom Alo that he launched the party because “One has to vote for some party. I don’t like any of them. I formed the Janapriya Party so that I could vote for my own party.”

Asked how he funds party activities, he said that 9–10 standing committee members each contribute monthly donations of Tk 500 to Tk 1,000. Office rent is Tk 25,000. He uses the office space for his personal business as well and therefore pays part of the rent himself.

On 25 October, this correspondent met him on Topkhana Road. He said he could not rent an office for the party due to financial constraints. That is why he sits at a labour federation office, which has been provided in the application to the EC for registration.

Hanif Bangladeshi said, “I marched on foot from Teknaf to Tetulia in 2018 demanding voting rights, democracy and the rule of law. I even staged a march to the home of Felani with a symbolic dead body in protest against border killings.”

Asked why he floated a political party, he said existing parties fail to honour their promises made to the people. Besides, it was hard to move ahead without an organisation.

The Bangladesh United Party was launched on 28 October. At the press conference, its chairman, Md Zakir Hossain, said the party has committees in at least 20 districts and over 100 upazilas.
However, only 60–70 people attended the event, including 20–25 journalists and YouTubers. Asked why attendance was so low if the party had so many committees, Zakir Hossain told Prothom Alo, “I do not see any need to bring everyone to Dhaka. It only increases traffic congestion.”

Earlier, on 26 April, the Bangladesh Notun Dhaka Janatar Party was launched at the National Press Club. On 7 November, when Prothom Alo requested the party’s office address, its convener Muhammad Abdul Ahad said it was located on the 6th floor of Darus Salam Bhaban in Purana Paltan. But a visit the next day found that the office actually belonged to a newspaper called Desher Dak.

Of the 26 new parties, only NCP has a large, well-equipped office on the 16th floor of Rupayan Tower at Banglamotor in the capital. The walls are decorated with graffiti referencing the mass uprising. The office includes modern facilities for press conferences and meetings, separate rooms for the convener and member secretary, and additional rooms for senior leaders.

NCP has a 216-member central committee. It has committees in most districts outside Dhaka, and also at metropolitan, upazila and thana levels.

Why so many new parties?

Professor Dil Rowshan Jinnat Ara Nazneen of Dhaka University’s Department of Political Science believes the country has no real need for so many political parties.

She told Prothom Alo that several motives may lie behind the surge. Those excluded over the past 16 years may be trying to enter politics again after the shift in circumstances, while others may be forming parties in pursuit of new influence or dominance.

She added that the public must remain vigilant about the ideals and intent behind these new parties: what they seek to implement and why they have been formed.

"Maulana Bhasani’s ‘Silence’","https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/op-ed/e7q3vhnepj","Published: 17 Nov 2025, 02: 27","The person we know as 'Maulana Bhasani' was not originally named that. Neither of these two words was part of his real name. Both 'Maulana' and 'Bhasani' were titles or epithets he acquired later. 'Maulana' reflected his religious faith and practice, while 'Bhasani' became a symbol of his struggle and rebellion. His life and activities were such that his real name faded behind these titles. In fact, his birth name was Abdul Hamid Khan, and his childhood nickname was Chaga, which was how he was known in his early years.

He had none of the wealth, status, or family influence that typically help in political and social establishment. Yet he drew from every experience in life—from traveling theatre troupes to the Deoband Madrasa. Among these experiences, the trait that ultimately made him remarkable was his deep connection with the masses. This connection allowed him to see life through the lens of the collective, linking his life with the lives of those around him.

He viewed imperialism, feudalism, and capitalism not from a distance, but through the experiences of oppressed people. He understood that poverty, helplessness, and a life of deprivation were not mere fate—they were created and sustained by specific causes, systems, and power structures.

This understanding set him apart from other maulanas and pirs. In a hypocritical world, he became solitary, while among the people he became a leader of the oppressed. He was not just a voice for Muslims; he became the voice for all oppressed people of the so-called Third World, regardless of religion, ethnicity, or gender.

He was not just a voice for Muslims; he became the voice for all oppressed people of the so-called Third World, regardless of religion, ethnicity, or gender.
In our society, religious leaders such as maulanas and pirs hold immense power. Rulers and exploiters always support them to maintain their own authority. At the same time, countless people approach these religious figures to cope with unbearable lives. People seek relief from ailments, protection for their children, divine help in crises, and safety from cruel oppressors through prayers, talismans, or charms. Where there is no money for treatment, no doctors, no medicine, and where people’s own strength is unclear; where rivers erode, and tyrants and the powerful commit oppression—the oppressed see no other way but to turn to such religious paths.

Most religious leaders take money, offer advice, and urge people to be patient, to endure, to accept their fate with satisfaction. Yet these leaders themselves remain bound to the very oppressors who are few in number but hold power. The dependence of religious leaders on oppressors, and of oppressors on religious certification, creates a vicious cycle in which they protect each other. For the oppressed, this produces a deadlock. Amid storms and aggressions, the only guidance offered to the battered people is religious practice and patience in this life for infinite rewards in the next. Such leaders’ teachings are thus often infused with power, misogyny, communalism, and other social toxins.

Maulana Bhasani: A leader of the oppressed 
Maulana Bhasani: A leader of the oppressed 
Maulana Bhasani was also a pir (spiritual guide). Millions of people were his disciples. Because he did not discriminate based on religion, caste, or gender, anyone could approach him. Men and women of different faiths, and especially poor people oppressed and exploited by landlords, moneylenders, and the ruling classes, came to him for help. Unlike many religious figures, Bhasani did not derive his income from their suffering. He offered prayers, charms, and spiritual guidance, but if someone was seriously ill, he advised them to see a doctor and even provided money for medicine if needed.

Unlike many religious figures, Bhasani did not derive his income from their suffering. He offered prayers, charms, and spiritual guidance, but if someone was seriously ill, he advised them to see a doctor and even provided money for medicine if needed.
What set Maulana Bhasani apart, and in some ways made him the opposite of other religious leaders, was his approach to injustice. People came to him for guidance and shared the indescribable hardships and injustices of their lives. Bhasani’s stance was that such suffering was not fate, not a divine decree, and above all, could be changed if people were united. This perspective drove him to adopt a rebellious position against injustice from his youth. For him, 'Rebellion against injustice is righteous' became another name for his life.

Bhasani’s life, speeches, and struggle angered the Pakistani state, dominated by the ownership of Islam, as well as military rulers, landlords, moneylenders, feudal lords, and their favoured religious leaders.
He was labeled a 'traitor to India', a 'lungi-clad Maulana', and even an 'apostate'. This hostility from rulers and oppressors was essentially a class-based resentment. In appearance, lifestyle, speech, and demeanor, Bhasani belonged to the lower class. Through struggle, he gave voice to the oppressed within Islam, standing against the elite interpretation of the faith. While religion was treated as a safe haven monopolised by rulers and oppressors, Bhasani challenged that sanctuary.

Injustice and suffering are not abstract, nor do they descend from some unknown planet. By observing these experiences with responsibility and sensitivity, one can uncover a vast truth: the causes of inhumane lives, the social structures, rules, and systems behind them. It becomes clear which classes and groups maintain and enforce these systems, using every means to perpetuate them—and religion is not exempt. The struggle for total liberation cannot be indefinite or aimless; it requires envisioning and working toward a society that can free people from this hellish condition.
Bhasani did not aim for the monarchy of Saudi Arabia; he envisioned a society liberated from exploitation, oppression, and inequality. He sought a social system that could bring people joy, dignity, and humanity. The struggle to establish such a society, he presented as a duty and responsibility to the people.

Therefore, to free people from injustice, oppression, and suffering, prayers alone are not enough; what is needed is the creation of collective struggle. This understanding enabled Maulana to become the symbol of resistance known as Bhasani. This Bhasani stood against the overwhelming power and aggression of all kinds of oppressors, channeling the voices of millions into his own, and confronting authority with the immense strength of the people. He gave tangible form to the limitless power rising from among the oppressed. His warnings against the oppressors not only revitalised weary, oppressed, and struggling people but also seemed to animate nature itself—'Silence!'

With this resolve, Maulana Bhasani participated in the 1971 Liberation War and, in the post-independence and disillusioned years, became a symbol of people’s despair and aspirations. He challenged the power of India’s ruling class and shook the country against the oppression at Farakka. Although his influence was undermined at times by the errors and impulsiveness of leftist leaders, and he himself faced moments of despair, his strengths and limitations both offer lessons for our struggle.

Fifty-four years after independence, at a time when the people of Bangladesh are facing setbacks contrary to the hopes of mass uprisings—confronted by imperialism, the multifaceted aggression of domestic and foreign rulers, plundering by various looter groups, confusion from the expansion of religious-fascist politics—Maulana Bhasani repeatedly emerges as a powerful voice for the liberation of the oppressed, challenging local and foreign tyrants, calling again and again: 'Silence!'
